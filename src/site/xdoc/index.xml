    <section name="Apache Commons RNG: Random Numbers Generators" href="summary">
      <p>
        Commons RNG provides implementations of pseudo-random numbers generators that are
        either faster or of higher quality (and sometimes both) than <code>java.util.Random</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Casual use is as simple as:

<source>import org.apache.commons.rng.UniformRandomProvider;
import org.apache.commons.rng.RandomSource;

// Instantiate a "Mersenne-Twister" generator with a factory method.
UniformRandomProvider rng = RandomSource.create(RandomSource.MT);

// Use it to produce a floating-point value between 0 and 1.
double random = rng.nextDouble();
</source>

      </p>

      <p>
        For more examples and more advanced usage, see the <a href="userguide/rng.html">userguide</a>.
